# Caddy2NCSA

Caddy2NCSA is a Caddy 2 JSON to NCSA vHost log converter util.

This is a very simple and badly hacked Python Script. I am a Programmer that grew up with Java and now writes 90% Kotlin and 10% C++20.

I am by no means a Python scripter so expect this code the be bad and break at any time.
